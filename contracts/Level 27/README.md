# Good Samaritan challenge - Level 27 

```yml
This smart contract has a vulnerability, because:
```

- when the player calls the requestDonation() and receives 10 tokens, the player can use this as an opportunity to attack, player simply reverts the transaction with the error NotEnoughBalance(),
- below, in the NatSpec comments I describe in further detail, how this attack unfolds over the various dependencies of the victim contract.

```Solidity
/// @notice This function is the main target in the attack from the victim contract GoodSamaritan.sol. 
function requestDonation() external returns(bool enoughBalance){
  // donate 10 coins to requester
  try wallet.donate10(msg.sender) {
    return true;
  } catch (bytes memory err) {
    if (keccak256(abi.encodeWithSignature("NotEnoughBalance()")) == keccak256(err)) {
      // send the coins left
      wallet.transferRemainder(msg.sender);
      return false;
    }
  }
}

/**
* @notice This is the interface used to notify attack contract called from the main attack suface, 
* a dependency of the victim contract.
*/
interface INotifyable {
    function notify(uint256 amount) external;
}

/** @notice This transfer function from contract Coin.sol, is the main attack surface from this dependency 
* of the victim contract, because of the second if() statement. Player will use INotifyable() from the attack 
* contract to intiate the attack on the main attack target from the victim contract. 
*/
   function transfer(address dest_, uint256 amount_) external {
        uint256 currentBalance = balances[msg.sender];

        // transfer only occurs if balance is enough
        if(amount_ <= currentBalance) {
            balances[msg.sender] -= amount_;
            balances[dest_] += amount_;

            if(dest_.isContract()) {
                // notify contract 
                INotifyable(dest_).notify(amount_);
            }
        } else {
            revert InsufficientBalance(currentBalance, amount_);
        }
    }
