# Token challenge - Level 5  üöß Work In Progress üèó

```yml
This smart contract has a vulnerability, it does not account for overflow or underflow leaving it vulnerable because:
```

- this transfer function allows for unsafe math operations resulting in an underflow vulnerability,

```Solidity
/** 
* @notice this transfer function has an underflow vulnerability that can be exploited, 
* if the player sends 21 tokens to another address it will create an underflow because the player
* only has 20 tokens and this underflow will leave the player with 2**256 - 1 tokens completing 
* this level! 
*/
function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool) {
  require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
  balances[msg.sender] -= _value; // <----- underflow here if 21 tokens transfered
  balances[_to] += _value;
  return true;
}
```

## üÜò The victim contract in detail

```yml
The victim contract should use the OpenZeppelin safeMath library:
```
- without the safeMath library overflow/underflow vulnerabilities remain, 

```Solidity

pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

/// @title Ethernaut challenge 5, hack contract steal as many tokens as you can 
/// @author Alejandro Santander
contract Token {
  /* 
  * state variable of mappings type, assigned in constructor each address will
  * show the amount of tokens they own as their balance 
  */
  mapping(address => uint) balances;
```

- TODO

```Solidity
// public state variable of integers type, assigned in constructor
    uint public totalSupply;

    /** @notice address that deployed this contract assigns initial supply amount
    as total supply and total supply is assigned to the balance of that address */
    constructor(uint _initialSupply) public {
        balances[msg.sender] = totalSupply = _initialSupply;
    }

        return true;
    }

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The vulnerability in detail

```yml
The vulnerability:
```

- I will demonstrate using uint8 underflow as an example below, and the best description I have found is from the hint,

- What is an odometer? According to my research an underflow or overflow is a lot like a odometer rolling over from 9999999 to 0000000, but that would be an overflow. In our situation, an underflow would be, similar to the "odometer" rolling backwards from 00000000 to 11111111.

- The result of a underflow, a *very* large number!
