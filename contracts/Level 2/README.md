# Fallout challenge - Level 2
```yml
This challenge is more about best practices and how using a constructor is the best practice because:
```
- using a constructor prevents slight mistakes from becoming critical vulnerabilities
  - in this challenge a spelling error creates a critical vulnerabilitiy, the author should have used a constructor instead of a function
