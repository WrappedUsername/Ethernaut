# Telephone challenge - Level 4
```yml
This smart contract has a vulnerability, it's use of tx.origin as authorization is a vulnerability because:
```
- if msg.sender is not tx.origin address _owner will equal owner.

```Solidity
/** 
* @notice function changeOwner() uses tx.origin to change ownership 
* to whatever address calls this function just as long as it is not the 
* address that started the original transaction that created this contract 
*/
function changeOwner(address _owner) public {
  if (tx.origin != msg.sender) {
    owner = _owner;
  }
}
```
